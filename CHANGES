Version 1.0.3 - 2011-07-02
  - Ecore::Labels extended. @node.find(:key1 => cond1, :key2 => cond2) and @node.find(:type => Contact, :key1 => cond) ...
    can be used to find nodes within a already initialized nodes. This is very resource intensive on large datasets, because
    every subnode (labeld with @node) will be checked for children and checked if those children do match) Also there is
    no caching of the results yet
    Still: @contact_folder.find(:type => Contact)  gives you a great tool to filter for nodes within all the depth of the hierarchy
    and look for those nodes. In conjunction with the folder's :default_controller attribute, this can be very powerful

Version 1.0.2 - 2011-06-25
  - Ecore::DataFile comes natively with ecore
  - Ecore::AuditLog has changed references in favour of working hand-written mappers
